### The Problem 
>A bookstore gives a 10% discount to employees and a 5% discount to VIP customers.
Calculate the amount to be paid by someone.  
The program should read the total amount to be paid and a code identifying if the client is an employee, a VIP, or an ordinary person.

### Why I chose this problem?
>I tried to use switch/case structure to solve this problem. Usually, I prefer to use if/else structure but it's not always the best way to solve this kind of problem. Aiming to practice the use of the switch/case structure and lose the habit of using the if/else structure, I chose this problem.
