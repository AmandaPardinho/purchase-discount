### Why I chose this problem?
>I tried to use switch/case structure to solve this problem. Usually, I prefer to use if/else structure but it's not always the best way to solve this kind of problem. Aiming to practice the use of the switch/case structure and lose the habit of using the if/else structure, I chose this problem.
